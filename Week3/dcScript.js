// Daily Challenge : Tell The Story
// This webpage has the start of a Mad Libs game.
// If you’ve never played it, that’s a game where you fill in a bunch of blanks inputs with different word types (ie : noun, adjective, verb), and then a story is generated based on those words, and sometimes the story is surprisingly funny.
// In this step, you’re going to finish the game logic in the event listener (check out the script tag below).

// Follow these steps :

// find the value of each of the input
// write out a story that uses each of the values
// Make sure you check the console for errors when you play the game.
