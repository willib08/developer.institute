// Daily Challenge : Not Bad
// Create a string that has the word “not” and “bad” inside
// Create another variable that should find the first appearance of the substring 
//“not” and “bad”.
// If the ‘bad’ follows the “not”, then it should replace the whole “not”
//…”bad” substring with ‘good’ than console.log the result.
// If it doesn’t find “not” and “bad” in the right sequence (or at all), 
//just console.log the original sentence.

//Example:
// Your string is : 'This dinner is not that bad!', the result is :
// 'This dinner is good!'
// Your string is : 'This movie is not so bad!' the result is :
// 'This movie is good!'
// Your string is : 'This dinner is bad!' the result is : 
//'This dinner is bad!'

let sentence = prompt("this dinner is not that bad!");
let words = sentence.split(" ");
console.log(words);

let not = words.indexof("not");
let bad = words.indexof("bad");
let n = bad - not;

if (not < bad){
	word.splice(not, n+1, "good");
	console.log(words.join(" "));
}
else
console.log(sentence);

console.log("not is located at "+ not + "position, and BAD is located at " +bad+ "position in this sentence");
